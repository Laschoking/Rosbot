This code was created during the project **Experimental Investigation of Existing Indoor Localisation Sensors and Estimation Techniques** at TU Dresden. 
It contains measurements on the accuracy of the Husarion ROSbot 3.0 utilising LiDAR with the AMCL package in comparison to data provided by a Kalman Filter fusing IMU and odometry data.
